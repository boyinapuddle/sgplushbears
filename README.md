Using a friend's website and Shopify account, I am going to learn how to Shopify! I will be learning how to use metaobjects, rendering sections, APIs, GraphQL requests, and ultimately creating themes from scratch.

I will then learn more about UI/UX to work on the page and ultimately help my friend build a shopify page for his business which he will be proud of.
